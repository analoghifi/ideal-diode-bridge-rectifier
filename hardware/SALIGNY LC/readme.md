## Saligny LC
Saligny LC - low current - offer very small solution size - 10 mm x 10 mm while keeping same Ideal Bridge features.

### Features:

*    Smaller solution size – Saligny LC is only 10mm x 10mm.
*    Maximises power efficiency.
*    Maximises available voltage and current.
*    Eliminate power thermal design problems.
*    No need for a heatsink.
*    Zero switching noise.
*    No secondary ringing in the transformer like PN or Schottky diodes.
*    If power source fails or is shorted a fast turn-off minimizes reverse current transients.

### Specifications:

*    Operates from DC to 600Hz.
*    AC operating voltage 6Vac to 30Vac.
*    DC operating voltage 9Vdc to 42Vdc.
*    Iq = 1,5mA.
*    Continuous load current up to 5A.
*    Peak 8A – 500ms.
*    **Require a minimum output capacitor of 470uF**
*    Do **<ins>not</ins>** support centre tapped transformer.
