DC1823B:

LT4320IDD Demo Board | 1.2kW Ideal Diode Bridge Full-Wave Rectifier [9V to 40V, 30A]

Demonstration circuit 1823B features the LT4320, an ideal diode bridge controller  suitable for applications that require high current AC to DC full-wave rectification or DC polarity correction. With an AC input, the input voltage range is 12VAC to 24VAC, the output voltage can be as high as 70V, and the output current can be as high as 1.5A. The AC current is limited by the capacitance provided on the demo board and can be increased up to 17A with additional load capacitance. The DC input voltage range is 9V up to 40V, and the maximum DC output current is 30A.
