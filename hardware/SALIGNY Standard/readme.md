## Saligny Standard
Saligny Standard is our Ideal Bridge solution for most common applications. It is available in a small footprint 32mm x 28mm

### Features:

*    Smaller solution size 32mm x 28,2mm – Saligny is smaller in size than equivalent diode bridge.
*    Pin compatible with standard rectifier
*    Maximises power efficiency.
*    Maximises available voltage and current.
*    Eliminate power thermal design problems.
*    No need for a heatsink.
*    Zero switching noise.
*    No secondary ringing in the transformer like PN or Schottky diodes.
*    If power source fails or is shorted a fast turn-off minimizes reverse current transients.

### Specifications:

*    Operates from DC to 600Hz.
*    AC operating voltage 6Vac to 51Vac.
*    DC operating voltage 9Vdc to 72Vdc.
*    Iq = 1,5mA.
*    Continuous load current up to 20A or more depending on mosfet configuration.
*    Over 200A pulsed current at Ta = 25Celsius ( Max Rθjc = 1.0C/W, pulse duration ≤100 μs, duty cycle ≤1%).
*    **Require a minimum output capacitor of 1000μF**
*    Do **<ins>not</ins>** support centre tapped transformer.
